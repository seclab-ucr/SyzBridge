# ExpBridge

## What is ExpBridge

ExpBridge is a research project that aims to adapt Linux upstream PoCs to downstream distributions.

## Why did we develop ExpBridge

Exploitability assessment is a popular topic in cybersecurity. Most exploitability assessment tools primarliy focus on Linux upstream kernel, which means they rely on original upstream PoCs. However, only a small portion (19%) of those upstream PoCs can trigger the same bugs on downstream distros. ExpBridge provides a capability to bridge this gap between upstream and downstream, adapting the upstream PoCs to downstream, providing more possibility to exploitability assessment tools.
